# Weak Supervision Experiments
This repository contains the as of now (June 2020) the code for the submitted "WeakAL: Combining Active Learning and Weak Supervision" paper for the [23rd International Conference on Discovery Science](https://ds2020.csd.auth.gr/).

The folder `active_learning` contains the standalone Active Learning Module including the Weak Supervision Code.

As the code actually does contain fairly small comments I'm trying to quickly explain here what the individual files do, if you're actually interested in using the code feel free to contact me if something's unclear.

## Experiments of general interest

### al_hyper_search.py

## Code for the experiments of the paper

### display_old_dwtc.ipynb
### display_random_search_results.ipynb
### fake_experiment_oracle.py
### save_new_200er_results.py
### save_old_results.py

## Experiments that didn't made it into the paper or didn't showed any results
### train_ann_with_weak_labels.py
